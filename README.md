# TimedCodingQuiz
# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

Acceptance Criteria / Goals for assignment:

*Create a timed coding quiz.
*When a start button is clicked, a timer starts, and a question is presented.
*When a question is answered, another question is presented.
*When a question is answered incorrect, then time is subtracted from the countdown clock.
When all questions are answered or the countdown clock reaches 0, then the game is over.
When the game is over, the player saves his/her initials and score to a high scores board.

Reflections:

1) I learned to better navigate functions in JavaScript.
2) I gained a better understanding of referencing objects in an array.
3) I learned how to locally store data.
4) The order of the code is super important; I fixed many small mistakes along the way by taking correct code that wasn't working and moving it to the appropriate location in the code block.
